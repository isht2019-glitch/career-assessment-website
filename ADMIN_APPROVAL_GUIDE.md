## 🔧 How to Approve Users (3 Methods)

### **Method 1: Browser Console (Easiest)**

1. Open your website: `https://career-assessment-website.pages.dev`
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Type this command and press Enter:
   ```javascript
   approveEmail('user@example.com')
   ```
   Replace `user@example.com` with the actual user's email

**Example:**
```javascript
approveEmail('john@gmail.com')
```

You'll see: `✅ Approved: john@gmail.com`

---

### **Method 2: View All Approved Emails**

In browser console, type:
```javascript
viewApprovedEmails()
```

This shows all currently approved emails.

---

### **Method 3: Pre-approve Multiple Emails**

In browser console, approve multiple users at once:
```javascript
approveEmail('user1@gmail.com')
approveEmail('user2@gmail.com')
approveEmail('user3@gmail.com')
```

## 📧 Payment Instructions Email Template

When a user submits their email, they see:
> "Check your email: **user@example.com**"
> 
> 📧 I've sent you payment details!  
> 💰 Pay the ₹1 using the information provided  
> ⏳ Once I verify your payment, I'll approve you  
> ✅ Then you can start the test!

**You should manually send them an email with:**
```

## 💾 How Data is Stored

**LocalStorage (User's Browser):**
- `pendingPaymentEmail`: The user's submitted email
- `paymentStatus`: Either 'pending' or 'approved'

**In-Memory (Your Browser Console):**
- `approvedEmails`: Array of approved emails (resets on page reload)

**Note:** For production, you should use Firebase Firestore or a backend database to store approvals permanently.

---

## 🔄 User Experience

### **Step 1: Email Submission**

## 🚀 Quick Approval Workflow

1. **User submits email** → You receive notification (check console logs)
2. **User pays ₹1** → User sends you payment proof
3. **You verify payment** → Open console, run `approveEmail('user@email.com')`
4. **User checks status** → User clicks "Check Approval Status" button
5. **User starts test** → Approved! 🎉

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

**Current System (Demo):**
- Approvals stored in browser memory
- Resets when you close the browser
- Good for testing/demo

**For Production:**
You should implement:
1. **Backend API** to store approvals in database
2. **Admin Dashboard** to manage approvals
3. **Email Notifications** when users submit
4. **Payment Gateway Integration** (Razorpay, Stripe)
5. **Webhook** to auto-approve after payment

---

## 📊 Monitor Submissions

To see when users submit emails, check browser console:
```
Payment email submitted: user@example.com
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **User says "Not approved yet"**
- Check if you ran `approveEmail('their-email@example.com')`
- Make sure email matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- User needs to click "Check Approval Status" button

### **Approval doesn't persist**
- Current system uses in-memory storage
- Approvals reset when you close browser
- For persistence, implement Firebase Firestore

### **User lost their pending status**
- They cleared browser data
- Ask them to submit email again
- Approve them again

## 🎯 Next Steps for Production

   - Store pending emails with timestamp

   - Send approval confirmation

4. **Payment Gateway:**
