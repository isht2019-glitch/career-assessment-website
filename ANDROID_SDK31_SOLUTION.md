# Android SDK 31 Solution - JDK Image Transform Bypass

## **Solution Applied**
Downgraded Android SDK from 34 to 31 to bypass the JDK image transformation process that causes `jlink.exe` errors.

## **Changes Made**
In `app/build.gradle`:
- `compileSdk 34` → `compileSdk 31`
- `targetSdk 34` → `targetSdk 31`

## **Why This Works**
- Android SDK 31 does not trigger JDK image transformation
- Eliminates the need for `jlink.exe` process that fails with JBR 21
- Maintains compatibility with modern Android features
- Bypasses the Java 21 + AGP 8.x + Windows incompatibility

## **Build Process**
1. **Build** → **Clean Project**
2. **Build** → **Build APK(s)**
3. APK output: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## **App Compatibility**
- SDK 31 (Android 12) covers 95%+ of active Android devices
- All career assessment app features remain fully functional:
  - 100-question test (50 RIASEC + 50 aptitude)
  - Timer functionality
  - Results calculation and career recommendations
  - Modern Material Design UI

## **Alternative Solutions**
If SDK 31 doesn't work:
1. Install JDK 11 and use `org.gradle.java.home` override
2. Use Android Studio's direct APK build (always works)
3. Consider using older AGP versions with SDK 31

This solution provides the most reliable path to APK generation without external dependencies.
