## üîß Technical Implementation

### Roadmap Generation System

The system uses modular helper functions to generate comprehensive roadmaps:

```javascript
function generateRoadmap(occupation) {
    return {
        // 10 major sections with detailed subsections
        highSchoolStage: {
            coreSubjects: generateCoreSubjects(occupation.field),
            extracurriculars: generateHighSchoolExtracurriculars(occupation.title),
            recommendedCertifications: generateSchoolCertifications(occupation.field),
            competitiveAdvantage: generateCompetitiveEdge(occupation.title),
            internshipOpportunities: generateSchoolInternships(occupation.field)
        },
        // ... 9 more comprehensive sections
    };
}
```

### Helper Functions (50+ specialized functions)
