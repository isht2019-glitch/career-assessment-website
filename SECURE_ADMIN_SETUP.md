## 📱 ANDROID APP INTEGRATION:

I'll create the Android version next! It will:
- ✅ Use same Firebase project
- ✅ Same Firestore collection
- ✅ Same approval system
- ✅ Shared requests between web and Android

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### **"Firestore not enabled"**
→ Go to Firebase Console → Enable Firestore

### **"Permission denied"**
→ Check Firestore rules (Step 3 above)

### **"Admin panel not loading"**
→ Wait 1-2 minutes after deployment

### **"User not getting approved"**
→ Check if Firestore updated (admin panel shows "Approved")
→ User needs to wait 10 seconds for auto-check

---
